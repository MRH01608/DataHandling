# DataHandling
A random assortment of simple scripts to automate tedious data handling needed when tracking flies etc

DLC_Cropping.py - Takes a .csv stating input video, x and y coordinates, start and stop times etc in order to crop out individual chambers and timepoints for videos recorded on the Goodwin group behaviour system. This script will populate a .bat file for easier processing of large numbers of videos through fmmpeg

FPS_Overlays.py - This will populate a file that can then be run in order to overlay the frame number onto a given video.
